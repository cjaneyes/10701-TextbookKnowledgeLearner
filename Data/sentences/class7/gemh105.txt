Lines and Angles 5.1 INTRODUCTION You already know how to identify different lines, line segments and angles in a given shape.
Can you identify the different line segments and angles formed in the following figures?
(Fig 5.1)  (i)  93  Chapter 5  LINES AND ANGLES  (ii)  (iii)  (iv)  Fig 5.1  Can you also identify whether the angles made are acute or obtuse or right?
-true	Recall that a line segment has two end points.
If we extend the two end points in either direction endlessly, we get a line.
-ture	Thus, we can say that a line has no end points.
-true	On the other hand, recall that a ray has one end point (namely its starting point).
For example, look at the figures given below:  (ii)  (i)  (iii) Fig 5.2  Here, Fig 5.2 (i) shows a line segment, Fig 5.2 (ii) shows a line and Fig 5.2 (iii) is that of a ray.
A line segment PQ is generally denoted by the symbol PQ , a line AB is denoted by JJJG the symbol AB and the ray OP is denoted by OP .
Give some examples of line segments and rays from your daily life and discuss them with your friends.
-notsure	94  MATHEMATICS  Again recall that an angle is formed when lines or line segments meet.
In Fig 5.1, observe the corners.
These corners are formed when two lines or line segments intersect at a point.
For example, look at the figures given below:  (i)  (ii) Fig 5.3  In Fig 5.3 (i) line segments AB and BC intersect at B to form angle ABC, and again line segments BC and AC intersect at C to form angle ACB and so on.
Whereas, in Fig 5.3 (ii) lines PQ and RS intersect at O to form four angles POS, SOQ, QOR and ROP.
An angle ABC is represented by the symbol TRY THESE ∠ABC.
Thus, in Fig 5.3 (i), the three angles formed are ∠ABC, ∠BCA List ten figures around you and ∠BAC, and in Fig 5.3 (ii), the four angles formed are ∠POS, ∠SOQ, and identify the acute, obtuse ∠QOR and ∠POR.
You have already studied how to classify the angles and right angles found in them.
as acute, obtuse or right angle.
Note: While referring to the measure of an angle ABC, we shall write m∠ABC as simply ∠ABC.
The context will make it clear, whether we are referring to the angle or its measure.
-true	5.2 RELATED ANGLES 5.2.1 Complementary Angles When the sum of the measures of two angles is 90°, the angles are called complementary angles.
(i)  (iii)  (ii)  Are these two angles complementary?
Yes  Fig 5.4  (iv)  Are these two angles complementary?
-true	No  Whenever two angles are complementary, each angle is said to be the complement of the other angle.
In the above diagram (Fig 5.4), the ‘30° angle’ is the complement of the ‘60° angle’ and vice versa.

5.2.2 Supplementary Angles Let us now look at the following pairs of angles (Fig 5.6):  (i)  (ii)  96  MATHEMATICS  (iii)  (iv)  Fig 5.6  Do you notice that the sum of the measures of the angles in each of the above pairs (Fig 5.6) comes out to be 180º?
Such pairs of angles are called supplementary angles.
When two angles are supplementary, each angle is said to be the supplement of the other.

5.2.3.
Adjacent Angles Look at the following figures:  B A  Look at this steering wheel of a car.
At the centre of the wheel you find three angles being formed, lying next to one another.
When you open a book it looks like the above figure.
In A and B, we find a pair of angles, placed next to each other.
Fig 5.8  At both the vertices A and B, we find, a pair of angles are placed next to each other.
These angles are such that: (i) they have a common vertex; (ii) they have a common arm; and (iii) the non-common arms are on either side of the common arm.
Such pairs of angles are called adjacent angles.

Are ∠1, ∠2 a linear pair?
Yes  (i)  Are ∠1, ∠2 a linear pair?
No!
(Why?)
Fig 5.11  (ii)  In Fig 5.11 (i) above, observe that the opposite rays (which are the non-common sides of ∠1 and ∠2) form a line.
Thus, ∠1 + ∠2 amounts to 180o.
-true	The angles in a linear pair are supplementary.
Have you noticed models of a linear pair in your environment?
Note carefully that a pair of supplementary angles form a linear pair when placed adjacent to each other.
Do you find examples of linear pair in your daily life?

Look at the four angles formed ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4.
∠1 is vertically opposite to ∠3.
and ∠2 is vertically opposite to ∠4.

Does ∠1 appear to be equal to ∠3?
Does ∠2 appear to be equal to ∠4?
Before checking this, let us see some real life examples for vertically opposite angles (Fig 5.15).
Fig 5.15  DO THIS Draw two lines l and m, intersecting at a point.
You can now mark ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4 as in the Fig (5.16).
Take a tracecopy of the figure on a transparent sheet.
Place the copy on the original such that ∠1 matches with its copy, ∠2 matches with its copy, ... etc.
Fix a pin at the point of intersection.
Rotate the copy by 180o.
Do the lines coincide again?
can be rotated to get  Fig 5.16  You find that ∠1 and ∠3 have interchanged their positions and so have ∠2 and ∠4.
This has been done without disturbing the position of the lines.
Thus, ∠1 = ∠3 and ∠2 = ∠4.
-true	LINES AND ANGLES  101  We conclude that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles so formed are equal.
Let us try to prove this using Geometrical Idea.
Let us consider two lines l and m. (Fig 5.17) We can arrive at this result through logical reasoning as follows: Let l and m be two lines, which intersect at O, making angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4.
Fig 5.17 We want to prove that ∠1 = ∠3 and ∠2 = ∠4 Now, ∠1 = 180º – ∠2 (Because ∠1, ∠2 form a linear pair, so, ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o) (i) Similarly, ∠3 = 180º – ∠2 (Since ∠2, ∠3 form a linear pair, so, ∠2 + ∠3 = 180o) (ii) Therfore, ∠1 = ∠3 [By (i) and (ii)] Similarly, we can prove that ∠2 = ∠4, (Try it!)

5.3.2 Transversal You might have seen a road crossing two or more roads or a railway line crossing several other lines (Fig 5.21).

They are lines on a plane that do not meet anywhere.
Can you identify parallel lines in the following figures?
(Fig 5.27)  Fig 5.27  Transversals of parallel lines give rise to quite interesting results.
LINES AND ANGLES  DO THIS Take a ruled sheet of paper.
Draw (in thick colour) two parallel lines l and m. Draw a transversal t to the lines l and m. Label ∠1 and ∠2 as shown [Fig 5.28(i)].
Place a tracing paper over the figure drawn.
Trace the lines l, m and t. Slide the tracing paper along t, until l coincides with m. You find that ∠1 on the traced figure coincides with ∠2 of the original figure.
In fact, you can see all the following results by similar tracing and sliding activity.
-true	(i) ∠1 = ∠2 (ii) ∠3 = ∠4 (iii) ∠5 = ∠6 (iv) ∠7 = ∠8  (i)  (iii)  (ii)  Fig 5.28  (iv)  This activity illustrates the following fact: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of corresponding angles are equal in measure.
We use this result to get another interesting result.
Look at Fig 5.29.
When t cuts the parallel lines, l, m, we get, ∠3 = ∠7 (vertically opposite angles).
But ∠7 = ∠8 (corresponding angles).
Therefore, ∠3 = ∠8  107  108  MATHEMATICS  You can similarly show that ∠1 = ∠6.
-true	Thus, we have the following result : If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of alternate interior angles are equal.
This second result leads to another interesting property.
Again, from Fig 5.29.
∠3 + ∠1 = 180° (∠3 and ∠1 form a linear pair) But ∠1 = ∠6 (A pair of alternate interior angles) Therefore, we can say that ∠3 + ∠6 = 180°.
Similarly, ∠1 + ∠8 = 180°.
-true	Thus, we obtain the following result:  Fig 5.29  If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary.
You can very easily remember these results if you can look for relevant ‘shapes’.
The F-shape stands for corresponding angles:  The Z - shape stands for alternate angles.
DO THIS Draw a pair of parallel lines and a transversal.
Verify the above three statements by actually measuring the angles.

When two lines are given, is there any method to check if they are parallel or not?
You need this skill in many life-oriented situations.
A draftsman uses a carpenter’s square and a straight edge (ruler) to draw these segments (Fig 5.30).
He claims they are parallel.
How?
Are you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to be equal?
(What is the transversal here?)
-true	Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of corresponding angles are equal, then the lines have to be parallel.
Look at the letter Z(Fig 5.31).
The horizontal segments here are parallel, because the alternate angles are equal.
-true	When a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of alternate interior angles are equal, the lines have to be parallel.
Fig 5.30  Fig 5.31  110  MATHEMATICS  Draw a line l (Fig 5.32).
Draw a line m, perpendicular to l. Again draw a line p, such that p is perpendicular to m. Thus, p is perpendicular to a perpendicular to l. You find p || l. How?
This is because you draw p such Fig 5.32 that ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o.

**Lines and Angles 5.1  You already know how to identify different lines, line segments and angles in a given shape.**
**Can you identify the different line segments and angles formed in the following figures?**
**Fig 5.1)  (i)  93  Chapter 5   AND   (ii)  (iii)  (iv)  Fig 5.1  Can you also identify whether the angles made are acute or obtuse or right?**
**-true	Recall that a line segment has two end points.**
**If we extend the two end points in either direction endlessly, we get a line.**
**Thus, we can say that a line has no end points.**
**-true	On the other hand, recall that a ray has one end point (namely its starting point).**
**For example, look at the figures given below:  (ii)  (i)  (iii) Fig 5.2  Here, Fig 5.2 (i) shows a line segment, Fig 5.2 (ii) shows a line and Fig 5.2 (iii) is that of a ray.**
**A line segment PQ is generally denoted by the symbol PQ , a line AB is denoted by JJJG the symbol AB and the ray OP is denoted by OP .**
**Give some examples of line segments and rays from your daily life and discuss them with your friends.**
**Again recall that an angle is formed when lines or line segments meet.**
**In Fig 5.1, observe the corners.**
**These corners are formed when two lines or line segments intersect at a point.**
**For example, look at the figures given below:  (i)  (ii) Fig 5.3  In Fig 5.3 (i) line segments AB and BC intersect at B to form angle ABC, and again line segments BC and AC intersect at C to form angle ACB and so on.**
**Whereas, in Fig 5.3 (ii) lines PQ and RS intersect at O to form four angles POS, SOQ, QOR and ROP.**
**An angle ABC is represented by the symbol TRY  ∠ABC.**
**Thus, in Fig 5.3 (i), the three angles formed are ∠ABC, ∠BCA List ten figures around you and ∠BAC, and in Fig 5.3 (ii), the four angles formed are ∠POS, ∠SOQ, and identify the acute, obtuse ∠QOR and ∠POR.**
**You have already studied how to classify the angles and right angles found in them.**
**as acute, obtuse or right angle.**
**Note: While referring to the measure of an angle ABC, we shall write m∠ABC as simply ∠ABC.**
**The context will make it clear, whether we are referring to the angle or its measure.**
**-true	Complementary Angles When the sum of the measures of two angles is 90°, the angles are called complementary angles.**
**Are these two angles complementary?**
**Yes  Fig 5.4  (iv)  Are these two angles complementary?**
**-true	No  Whenever two angles are complementary, each angle is said to be the complement of the other angle.**
**In the above diagram (Fig 5.4), the ‘30° angle’ is the complement of the ‘60° angle’ and vice versa.**
**AND      AND  95    1.**
**Can two acute angles be complement to each other?**
**Can two obtuse angles be complement to each other?**
**Can two right angles be complement to each other?**
**Which pairs of following angles are complementary?**

**What is the measure of the complement of each of the following angles?**
**(i) 45º (ii) 65º (iii) 41º (iv) 54º o 3.**
**The difference in the measures of two complementary angles is 12 .**
**Find the measures of the angles.**
**Supplementary Angles Let us now look at the following pairs of angles (Fig 5.6):  (i)  (ii)  96    (iii)  (iv)  Fig 5.6  Do you notice that the sum of the measures of the angles in each of the above pairs (Fig 5.6) comes out to be 180º?**
**Such pairs of angles are called supplementary angles.**
**When two angles are supplementary, each angle is said to be the supplement of the other.**
**AND    1.**
**Can two obtuse angles be supplementary?**
**Can two acute angles be supplementary?**
**Can two right angles be supplementary?**
**Find the pairs of supplementary angles in Fig 5.7:  (i)  (iii)  (ii)  Fig 5.7  (iv)   AND   97  2.**
**What will be the measure of the supplement of each one of the following angles?**
**(i) 100º (ii) 90º (iii) 55º (iv) 125º 3.**
**Among two supplementary angles the measure of the larger angle is 44o more than the measure of the smaller.**
**Adjacent Angles Look at the following figures:  B A  Look at this steering wheel of a car.**
**At the centre of the wheel you find three angles being formed, lying next to one another.**
**When you open a book it looks like the above figure.**
**In A and B, we find a pair of angles, placed next to each other.**
**Fig 5.8  At both the vertices A and B, we find, a pair of angles are placed next to each other.**
**These angles are such that: (i) they have a common vertex; (ii) they have a common arm; and (iii) the non-common arms are on either side of the common arm.**
**Such pairs of angles are called adjacent angles.**
**-true	Adjacent angles have a common vertex and a common arm but no common interior points.**
**Are the angles marked 1 and 2 adjacent?**
**If they are not adjacent, say, ‘why’.**
**(i)  (ii)  (iii)  98    (iv)  2.**
**In the given Fig 5.10, are the following adjacent angles?**
**AOB and ∠BOC (b) ∠BOD and ∠BOC Justify your answer.**
**Fig 5.10    1.**
**Fig 5.9  AND    Can two adjacent angles be supplementary?**
**Can two adjacent angles be complementary?**
**Can two obtuse angles be adjacent angles?**
**Can an acute angle be adjacent to an obtuse angle?**
**-true	Linear Pair A linear pair is a pair of adjacent angles whose non-common sides are opposite rays.**
**Are ∠1, ∠2 a linear pair?**
**Yes  (i)  Are ∠1, ∠2 a linear pair?**
**Fig 5.11  (ii)  In Fig 5.11 (i) above, observe that the opposite rays (which are the non-common sides of ∠1 and ∠2) form a line.**
**Thus, ∠1 + ∠2 amounts to 180o.**
**-true	The angles in a linear pair are supplementary.**
**Have you noticed models of a linear pair in your environment?**
**Note carefully that a pair of supplementary angles form a linear pair when placed adjacent to each other.**
**Do you find examples of linear pair in your daily life?**
**AND   Observe a vegetable chopping board (Fig 5.12).**
**A vegetable chopping board The chopping blade makes a linear pair of angles with the board.**
**A pen stand The pen makes a linear pair of angles with the stand.**
**Fig 5.12     AND   1.**
**Can two acute angles form a linear pair?**
**Can two obtuse angles form a linear pair?**
**Can two right angles form a linear pair?**
**TRY  Check which of the following pairs of angles form a linear pair (Fig 5.13):  60°  40° 60°  (i)  (ii)  65°  90°  80°  (iii)  Fig 5.13  (iv)  100    5.2.5 Vertically Opposite Angles Next take two pencils and tie them with the help of a rubber band at the middle as shown (Fig 5.14).**
**Look at the four angles formed ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4.**
**∠1 is vertically opposite to ∠3.**
**and ∠2 is vertically opposite to ∠4.**
**We call ∠1 and ∠3, a pair of vertically opposite angles.**
**Fig 5.14 Can you name the other pair of vertically opposite angles?**
**Does ∠1 appear to be equal to ∠3?**
**Does ∠2 appear to be equal to ∠4?**
**Before checking this, let us see some real life examples for vertically opposite angles (Fig 5.15).**
**Fig 5.15  DO THIS Draw two lines l and m, intersecting at a point.**
**You can now mark ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4 as in the Fig (5.16).**
**Take a tracecopy of the figure on a transparent sheet.**
**Place the copy on the original such that ∠1 matches with its copy, ∠2 matches with its copy, ... etc.**
**Fix a pin at the point of intersection.**
**Rotate the copy by 180o.**
**Do the lines coincide again?**
**Fig 5.16  You find that ∠1 and ∠3 have interchanged their positions and so have ∠2 and ∠4.**
**This has been done without disturbing the position of the lines.**
**Thus, ∠1 = ∠3 and ∠2 = ∠4.**
**-true	AND   101  We conclude that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles so formed are equal.**
**Let us try to prove this using Geometrical Idea.**
**Let us consider two lines l and m. (Fig 5.17) We can arrive at this result through logical reasoning as follows: Let l and m be two lines, which intersect at O, making angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4.**
**Fig 5.17 We want to prove that ∠1 = ∠3 and ∠2 = ∠4 Now, ∠1 = 180º – ∠2 (Because ∠1, ∠2 form a linear pair, so, ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o) (i) Similarly, ∠3 = 180º – ∠2 (Since ∠2, ∠3 form a linear pair, so, ∠2 + ∠3 = 180o) (ii) Therfore, ∠1 = ∠3 [By (i) and (ii)] Similarly, we can prove that ∠2 = ∠4, (Try it!)**
**In the given figure, if ∠1 = 30º, find ∠2 and ∠3.**

**Fig 5.25  Alternate interior angles (like ∠3 and ∠6 in Fig 5.26) (i) have different vertices (ii) are on opposite sides of the transversal and (iii) lie ‘between’ the two lines.**
**Fig 5.26  TRY  Name the pairs of angles in each figure:  5.3.4 Transversal of Parallel Lines Do you remember what parallel lines are?**
**They are lines on a plane that do not meet anywhere.**
**Can you identify parallel lines in the following figures?**
**Fig 5.27)  Fig 5.27  Transversals of parallel lines give rise to quite interesting results.**
**AND   DO THIS Take a ruled sheet of paper.**
**Draw (in thick colour) two parallel lines l and m. Draw a transversal t to the lines l and m. Label ∠1 and ∠2 as shown [Fig 5.28(i)].**
**Place a tracing paper over the figure drawn.**
**Trace the lines l, m and t. Slide the tracing paper along t, until l coincides with m. You find that ∠1 on the traced figure coincides with ∠2 of the original figure.**
**In fact, you can see all the following results by similar tracing and sliding activity.**
**-true	Fig 5.28  (iv)  This activity illustrates the following fact: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of corresponding angles are equal in measure.**
**We use this result to get another interesting result.**
**When t cuts the parallel lines, l, m, we get, ∠3 = ∠7 (vertically opposite angles).**
**But ∠7 = ∠8 (corresponding angles).**
**Therefore, ∠3 = ∠8  107  108    You can similarly show that ∠1 = ∠6.**
**-true	Thus, we have the following result : If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of alternate interior angles are equal.**
**This second result leads to another interesting property.**
**Again, from Fig 5.29.**
**But ∠1 = ∠6 (A pair of alternate interior angles) Therefore, we can say that ∠3 + ∠6 = 180°.**
**Similarly, ∠1 + ∠8 = 180°.**
**-true	Thus, we obtain the following result:  Fig 5.29  If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary.**
**You can very easily remember these results if you can look for relevant ‘shapes’.**
**The F-shape stands for corresponding angles:  The Z - shape stands for alternate angles.**

**When two lines are given, is there any method to check if they are parallel or not?**
**You need this skill in many life-oriented situations.**

**He claims they are parallel.**
**Are you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to be equal?**
**What is the transversal here?)**
**-true	Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of corresponding angles are equal, then the lines have to be parallel.**
**Look at the letter Z(Fig 5.31).**
**The horizontal segments here are parallel, because the alternate angles are equal.**
**-true	When a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of alternate interior angles are equal, the lines have to be parallel.**
**Fig 5.30  Fig 5.31  110    Draw a line l (Fig 5.32).**
**Draw a line m, perpendicular to l. Again draw a line p, such that p is perpendicular to m. Thus, p is perpendicular to a perpendicular to l. You find p || l. How?**
**This is because you draw p such Fig 5.32 that ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o.**
**-true	Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary, the lines have to be parallel.**

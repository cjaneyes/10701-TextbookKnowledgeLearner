223  e  AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES  12  © o N be C E re R pu T bl is h AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES  12.1 Introduction  no  tt  You are already familiar with some methods of finding perimeters and areas of simple plane figures such as rectangles, squares, parallelograms, triangles and circles from your earlier classes.
Many objects that we come across in our daily life are related to the circular shape in some form or the other.
Cycle wheels, wheel barrow (thela), dartboard, round cake, papad, drain cover, various designs, bangles, brooches, circular paths, washers, flower beds, etc.
are some examples of such objects (see Fig.
12.1).
So, the problem of finding perimeters and areas related to circular figures is of great practical importance.
In this chapter, we shall begin our discussion with a review of the concepts of perimeter (circumference) and area of a circle and apply this knowledge in finding the areas of two special ‘parts’ of a circular region (or briefly of a circle) known as sector and segment.
We shall also see how to find the areas of some combinations of plane figures involving circles or their parts.

You also know from your earlier classes, that circumference of a circle bears a constant ratio with its diameter.
This constant ratio is denoted by the Greek letter π (read as ‘pi’).
In other words,  circumference = π × diameter  or,  = π × 2r (where r is the radius of the circle) = 2πr  The great Indian mathematician Aryabhatta (C.E.
476 – 550) gave an approximate  62832 , which is nearly equal to 3.1416.
It is also 20000 interesting to note that using an identity of the great mathematical genius Srinivas Ramanujan (1887–1920) of India, mathematicians have been able to calculate the value of π correct to million places of decimals.
As you know from Chapter 1 of Class IX, π is an irrational number and its decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-recurring (non-repeating).
However, for practical purposes, we generally take value of π.
He stated that π =  the value of π as  22 or 3.14, approximately.
7  no  tt  You may also recall that area of a circle is πr2, where r is the radius of the circle.
Recall that you have verified it in Class VII, by cutting a circle into a number of sectors and rearranging them as shown in Fig.
12.2.
Fig 12.2  File Name : C:\Class - X (Maths)/Final/Chap-12 28.011.06  AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES  225  1 You can see that the shape in Fig.
12.2 (ii) is nearly a rectangle of length × 2 π r 2 1 and breadth r. This suggests that the area of the circle = × 2πr × r = πr2.
Let us 2 recall the concepts learnt in earlier classes, through an example.
© o N be C E re R pu T bl is h  e  Example 1 : The cost of fencing a circular field at the rate of ` 24 per metre is ` 5280.
The field is to be ploughed at the rate of ` 0.50 per m2.
Find the cost of 22 ).
ploughing the field (Take π = 7 Total cost 5280 = 220 Solution : Length of the fence (in metres) = = Rate 24 So, circumference of the field = 220 m Therefore, if r metres is the radius of the field, then 2πr = 220  or,  2×  or, i.e., radius of the field is 35 m.  22 × 35 × 35 m2 = 22 × 5 × 35 m2 7 cost of ploughing 1 m2 of the field = ` 0.50  Therefore, Now,  So,  22 × r = 220 7 220 × 7 = 35 r= 2 × 22  area of the field = πr2 =  total cost of ploughing the field = ` 22 × 5 × 35 × 0.50 = ` 1925  EXERCISE 12.1  Unless stated otherwise, use π =  22 7  .

Tick the correct answer in the following and justify your choice : If the perimeter and the area of a circle are numerically equal, then the radius of the circle is (B) π units  (C) 4 units  (D) 7 units  e  (A) 2 units  12.3 Areas of Sector and Segment of a Circle  © o N be C E re R pu T bl is h  You have already come across the terms sector and segment of a circle in your earlier classes.
Recall that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed between a chord and the corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle.
Thus, in Fig.
12.4, shaded region OAPB is a sector Fig.
12.4 of the circle with centre O.
∠ AOB is called the angle of the sector.
Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of the circle.
For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and OAQB is called the major sector.
You can also see that angle of the major sector is 360° – ∠ AOB.
Now, look at Fig.
12.5 in which AB is a chord of the circle with centre O.
So, shaded region APB is a segment of the circle.
You can also note that unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle formed by the chord AB.
For obvious reasons, APB is called the minor segment and AQB is called the major segment.
Remark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’ we will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor sector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.
Fig.
12.5  tt  Now with this knowledge, let us try to find some relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.
no  Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre O and radius r (see Fig.
12.6).
Let the degree measure of ∠ AOB be θ.
You know that area of a circle (in fact of a circular region or disc) is πr2.
File Name : C:\Class - X (Maths)/Final/Chap-12 28.011.06  Fig.
12.6  AREAS RELATED TO CIRCLES  227  In a way, we can consider this circular region to be a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree measure 360) at the centre O.
Now by applying the Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the sector OAPB as follows:  © o N be C E re R pu T bl is h  e  When degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the sector = πr 2 So, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the πr 2 ⋅ sector = 360 Therefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is θ, area of the  θ πr 2 × πr 2 .
×θ = 360 360 Thus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a circle: sector =  Area of the sector of angle θ =  θ × πr 2 , 360  where r is the radius of the circle and θ the angle of the sector in degrees.
Now, a natural question arises : Can we find the length of the arc APB corresponding to this sector?
Yes.
Again, by applying the Unitary Method and taking the whole length of the circle (of angle 360°) as 2πr, we can obtain the required θ × 2πr .
length of the arc APB as 360 θ × 2πr .
So, length of an arc of a sector of angle θ = 360 Now let us take the case of the area of the segment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r (see Fig.
12.7).
You can see that :  Fig.
12.7  tt  Area of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB – Area of Δ OAB  no  θ × πr 2 – area of Δ OAB 360 Note : From Fig.
12.6 and Fig.
12.7 respectively, you can observe that : =  Area of the major sector OAQB = πr2 – Area of the minor sector OAPB  and  Area of major segment AQB = πr2 – Area of the minor segment APB  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Class - X (Maths)/Final/Chap-12 28.011.06  228  MATHEMATICS  Let us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results).

Also, find the area of the corresponding major sector (Use π = 3.14).

12.8).

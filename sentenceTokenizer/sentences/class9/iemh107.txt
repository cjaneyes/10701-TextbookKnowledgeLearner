d he  CHAPTER 7  bl  7.1 Introduction  is  TRIANGLES  © no N C tt E o R be T re pu  You have studied about triangles and their various properties in your earlier classes.
You know that a closed figure formed by three intersecting lines is called a triangle.
(‘Tri’ means ‘three’).
A triangle has three sides, three angles and three vertices.
For example, in triangle ABC, denoted as ∆ ABC (see Fig.
7.1); AB, BC, CA are the three sides, ∠ A, ∠ B, ∠ C are the three angles and A, B, C are three vertices.
In Chapter 6, you have also studied some properties of triangles.
In this chapter, you will study in details about the congruence of triangles, rules of congruence, some more properties of triangles and inequalities in a triangle.
You have already verified most of these properties in earlier classes.
We will now prove some of them.
7.2 Congruence of Triangles  Fig.
7.1  You must have observed that two copies of your photographs of the same size are identical.
Similarly, two bangles of the same size, two ATM cards issued by the same bank are identical.
You may recall that on placing a one rupee coin on another minted in the same year, they cover each other completely.
Do you remember what such figures are called?
Indeed they are called congruent figures (‘congruent’ means equal in all respects or figures whose shapes and sizes are both the same).
Now, draw two circles of the same radius and place one on the other.
What do you observe?
They cover each other completely and we call them as congruent circles.
110  MATHEMATICS  Fig.
7.2  he  d  Repeat this activity by placing one square on the other with sides of the same measure (see Fig.
7.2) or by placing two equilateral triangles of equal sides on each other.
You will observe that the squares are congruent to each other and so are the equilateral triangles.
bl  is  You may wonder why we are studying congruence.
You all must have seen the ice tray in your refrigerator.
Observe that the moulds for making ice are all congruent.
The cast used for moulding in the tray also has congruent depressions (may be all are rectangular or all circular or all triangular).
So, whenever identical objects have to be produced, the concept of congruence is used in making the cast.
© no N C tt E o R be T re pu  Sometimes, you may find it difficult to replace the refill in your pen by a new one and this is so when the new refill is not of the same size as the one you want to remove.
Obviously, if the two refills are identical or congruent, the new refill fits.
So, you can find numerous examples where congruence of objects is applied in daily life situations.
Can you think of some more examples of congruent figures?
Now, which of the following figures are not congruent to the square in Fig 7.3 (i) :  Fig.
7.3  The large squares in Fig.
7.3 (ii) and (iii) are obviously not congruent to the one in Fig 7.3 (i), but the square in Fig 7.3 (iv) is congruent to the one given in Fig 7.3 (i).
Let us now discuss the congruence of two triangles.
You already know that two triangles are congruent if the sides and angles of one triangle are equal to the corresponding sides and angles of the other triangle.

7.4 (i)?
Fig.
7.4  Cut out each of these triangles from Fig.
7.4 (ii) to (v) and turn them around and try to cover ∆ ABC.
Observe that triangles in Fig.
7.4 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are congruent to ∆ ABC while ∆ TSU of Fig 7.4 (v) is not congruent to ∆ ABC.
If ∆ PQR is congruent to ∆ ABC, we write ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC.
Notice that when ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC, then sides of ∆ PQR fall on corresponding equal sides of ∆ ABC and so is the case for the angles.
That is, PQ covers AB, QR covers BC and RP covers CA; ∠ P covers ∠ A, ∠ Q covers ∠ B and ∠ R covers ∠ C. Also, there is a one-one correspondence between the vertices.
That is, P corresponds to A, Q to B, R to C and so on which is written as P ↔ A, Q ↔ B, R ↔ C  Note that under this correspondence, ∆ PQR ≅ ∆ ABC; but it will not be correct to write ∆QRP ≅ ∆ ABC.

d  So, ∆ FDE ≅ ∆ ABC but writing ∆ DEF ≅ ∆ ABC is not correct.
is  Note that in congruent triangles corresponding parts are equal and we write in short ‘CPCT’ for corresponding parts of congruent triangles.
7.3 Criteria for Congruence of Triangles  bl  In earlier classes, you have learnt four criteria for congruence of triangles.
Let us recall them.
© no N C tt E o R be T re pu  Draw two triangles with one side 3 cm.
Are these triangles congruent?
Observe that they are not congruent (see Fig.
7.5).
Fig.
7.5  Now, draw two triangles with one side 4 cm and one angle 50° (see Fig.
7.6).
Are they congruent?
Fig.
7.6  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  TRIANGLES  113  See that these two triangles are not congruent.
So, equality of one pair of sides or one pair of sides and one pair of angles is not sufficient to give us congruent triangles.
he  What would happen if the other pair of arms (sides) of the equal angles are also equal?
d  Repeat this activity with some more pairs of triangles.
In Fig 7.7, BC = QR, ∠ B = ∠ Q and also, AB = PQ.
Now, what can you say about congruence of Δ ABC and Δ PQR?
is  Recall from your earlier classes that, in this case, the two triangles are congruent.
Verify this for ∆ ABC and ∆ PQR in Fig.
7.7.
© no N C tt E o R be T re pu  bl  Repeat this activity with other pairs of triangles.
Do you observe that the equality of two sides and the included angle is enough for the congruence of triangles?
Yes, it is enough.
Fig.
7.7  This is the first criterion for congruence of triangles.
Axiom 7.1 (SAS congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of the other triangle.
This result cannot be proved with the help of previously known results and so it is accepted true as an axiom (see Appendix 1).
Let us now take some examples.
Example 1 : In Fig.
7.8, OA = OB and OD = OC.
Show that (i) ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ BOC and  (ii) AD || BC.
Solution : (i) You may observe that in ∆ AOD and ∆ BOC, OA = OB ⎫ ⎬  OD = OC ⎭  (Given)  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  Fig.
7.8  114  MATHEMATICS  Also, since ∠ AOD and ∠ BOC form a pair of vertically opposite angles, we have ∠ AOD = ∠ BOC.
(by the SAS congruence rule)  he  (ii) In congruent triangles AOD and BOC, the other corresponding parts are also equal.
So, ∠ OAD = ∠ OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments AD and BC.
Therefore,  AD || BC.
bl  © no N C tt E o R be T re pu  Solution : Line l ⊥ AB and passes through C which is the mid-point of AB (see Fig.
7.9).
You have to show that PA = PB.
Consider ∆ PCA and ∆ PCB.
is  Example 2 : AB is a line segment and line l is its perpendicular bisector.
If a point P lies on l, show that P is equidistant from A and B.
We have  AC = BC  (C is the mid-point of AB)  ∠ PCA = ∠ PCB = 90° PC = PC  So,  d  ∆ AOD ≅ ∆ BOC  So,  (Given)  (Common)  ∆ PCA ≅ ∆ PCB (SAS rule)  and so, PA = PB, as they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles.
Fig.
7.9  Now, let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the angles is 50° and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig.
7.10).
Are the two triangles congruent?

7.10  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  TRIANGLES  115  Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles.
You will observe that for triangles to be congruent, it is very important that the equal angles are included between the pairs of equal sides.
he  So, SAS congruence rule holds but not ASS or SSA rule.
d  Notice that the two triangles are not congruent.
© no N C tt E o R be T re pu  bl  is  Next, try to construct the two triangles in which two angles are 60° and 45° and the side included between these angles is 4 cm (see Fig.
7.11).
Fig.
7.11  Cut out these triangles and place one triangle on the other.
What do you observe?
See that one triangle covers the other completely; that is, the two triangles are congruent.
Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles.
You will observe that equality of two angles and the included side is sufficient for congruence of triangles.
This result is the Angle-Side-Angle criterion for congruence and is written as ASA criterion.
You have verified this criterion in earlier classes, but let us state and prove this result.
Since this result can be proved, it is called a theorem and to prove it, we use the SAS axiom for congruence.
Theorem 7.1 (ASA congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of other triangle.
Proof : We are given two triangles ABC and DEF in which: ∠ B = ∠ E, ∠ C = ∠ F  and  We need to prove that  BC = EF  ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ DEF  For proving the congruence of the two triangles see that three cases arise.

You may observe that  Fig.
7.12  Case (ii) : Let if possible AB > DE.
So, we can take a point P on AB such that PB = DE.
Now consider ∆ PBC and ∆ DEF (see Fig.
7.13).
Fig.
7.13  Observe that in ∆ PBC and ∆ DEF,  PB = DE  (By construction)  ∠ B= ∠E  (Given)  BC = EF  (Given)  So, we can conclude that:  ∆ PBC ≅ ∆ DEF, by the SAS axiom for congruence.
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  TRIANGLES  117  Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts will be equal.
∠ PCB = ∠ DFE  So, But, we are given that  d  ∠ ACB = ∠ DFE  he  ∠ ACB = ∠ PCB  So, Is this possible?
or,  BA = ED  So,  ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ DEF  is  This is possible only if P coincides with A.
(by SAS axiom)  bl  Case (iii) : If AB < DE, we can choose a point M on DE such that ME = AB and repeating the arguments as given in Case (ii), we can conclude that AB = DE and so, ∆ ABC ≅ ∆ DEF.
© no N C tt E o R be T re pu  Suppose, now in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of angles.
Are the triangles still congruent?
You will observe that they are congruent.
Can you reason out why?
You know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
So if two pairs of angles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180° – sum of equal angles).
So, two triangles are congruent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal.
We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule.
Now let us perform the following activity :  Draw triangles with angles 40°, 50° and 90°.
How many such triangles can you draw?
In fact, you can draw as many triangles as you want with different lengths of sides (see Fig.
7.14).

7.41  bl  is  he  So far, you have been mainly studying the equality of sides and angles of a triangle or triangles.
Sometimes, we do come across unequal objects, we need to compare them.
For example, line-segment AB is greater in length as compared to line segment CD in Fig.
7.41 (i) and ∠ A is greater than ∠ B in Fig 7.41 (ii).
d  7.6 Inequalities in a Triangle  © no N C tt E o R be T re pu  Let us now examine whether there is any relation between unequal sides and unequal angles of a triangle.
For this, let us perform the following activity:  Activity : Fix two pins on a drawing board say at B and C and tie a thread to mark a side BC of a triangle.
Fix one end of another thread at C and tie a pencil at the other (free) end .
Mark a point A with the pencil and draw ∆ ABC (see Fig 7.42).
Now, shift the pencil and mark another point A′ on CA beyond A (new position of it) So,  A′C > AC  (Comparing the lengths)  Join A′ to B and complete the triangle A′BC.
What can you say about ∠ A′BC and ∠ ABC?
Compare them.
What do you observe?
Clearly,  Fig.
7.42  ∠ A′BC > ∠ ABC  Continue to mark more points on CA (extended) and draw the triangles with the side BC and the points marked.
You will observe that as the length of the side AC is increased (by taking different positions of A), the angle opposite to it, that is, ∠ B also increases.
Let us now perform another activity :  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  130  MATHEMATICS  Activity : Construct a scalene triangle (that is a triangle in which all sides are of different lengths).
Measure the lengths of the sides.
d  Now, measure the angles.
What do you observe?
he  In ∆ ABC of Fig 7.43, BC is the longest side and AC is the shortest side.
Also, ∠ A is the largest and ∠ B is the smallest.
Fig.
7.43  Repeat this activity with some other triangles.
is  We arrive at a very important result of inequalities in a triangle.
It is stated in the form of a theorem as shown below:  © no N C tt E o R be T re pu  You may prove this theorem by taking a point P on BC such that CA = CP in Fig.
7.43.  bl  Theorem 7.6 : If two sides of a triangle are unequal, the angle opposite to the longer side is larger (or greater).
Now, let us perform another activity :  Activity : Draw a line-segment AB.
With A as centre and some radius, draw an arc and mark different points say P, Q, R, S, T on it.
Fig.
7.44  Join each of these points with A as well as with B (see Fig.
7.44).
Observe that as we move from P to T, ∠ A is becoming larger and larger.
What is happening to the length of the side opposite to it?
Observe that the length of the side is also increasing; that is ∠ TAB > ∠ SAB > ∠ RAB > ∠ QAB > ∠ PAB and TB > SB > RB > QB > PB.
Now, draw any triangle with all angles unequal to each other.
Measure the lengths of the sides (see Fig.
7.45).
Observe that the side opposite to the largest angle is the longest.
In Fig.
7.45, ∠ B is the largest angle and AC is the longest side.
Repeat this activity for some more triangles and we see that the converse of Theorem 7.6 is also true.
In this way, we arrive at the following theorem:  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  Fig.
7.45  TRIANGLES  131  Theorem 7.7 : In any triangle, the side opposite to the larger (greater) angle is longer.
You will observe that  AB + BC > AC, BC + AC > AB and AC + AB > BC.
he  Now take a triangle ABC and in it, find AB + BC, BC + AC and AC + AB.
What do you observe?
bl  is  Repeat this activity with other triangles and with this you can arrive at the following theorem : Theorem 7.8 : The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side.
© no N C tt E o R be T re pu  In Fig.
7.46, observe that the side BA of ∆ ABC has been produced to a point D such that AD = AC.
Can you show that ∠ BCD > ∠ BDC and BA + AC > BC?
Have you arrived at the proof of the above theorem.
Let us now take some examples based on these results.
Fig.
7.46  Example 9 : D is a point on side BC of ∆ ABC such that AD = AC (see Fig.
7.47).
Show that AB > AD.
Solution : In ∆ DAC,  AD = AC  So,  (Given)  ∠ ADC = ∠ ACD  (Angles opposite to equal sides)  Now,  ∠ ADC is an exterior angle for ∆ABD.
So,  ∠ ADC > ∠ ABD  or,  ∠ ACD > ∠ ABD  or,  ∠ ACB > ∠ ABC  Fig.
7.47  So,  AB > AC (Side opposite to larger angle in ∆ ABC)  or,  AB > AD (AD = AC)  File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006).PM65  d  This theorem can be proved by the method of contradiction.

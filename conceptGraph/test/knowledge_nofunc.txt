Remark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this second polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third polygon.
DF  Remark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle, then their third angles will also be equal.
The lengths of the two tangents from an external point to a circle are equal.
A triangle having two equal sides is called an Isosceles Triangle [(b),(f)].
A triangle having three equal sides is called an Equilateral Triangle [(a),(d)].
Naming triangles based on angles If each angle is less than 90°, then the triangle is called an acute angled triangle.
If any one angle is a right angle then the triangle is called a right angled triangle.
If any one angle is greater than 90°, then the triangle is called an obtuse angled triangle.
One more obvious property of the rectangle you can see is that opposite sides are of equal length.
The measure of a right angle is 90° and 
hence that measure of a straight angle is 180°.
In an equilateral triangle, each angle has measure 60°.
A triangle is said to be isosceles, if at least any two of its sides are of same length.
If two line segments have the same (i.e., equal) length, they are congruent.
Two line segments, say, AB and CD , are congruent if they have equal lengths.
Two angles, say, ∠ABC and ∠PQR, are congruent if their measures are equal.
RHS Congruence of two right-angled triangles: Under a given correspondence, two right-angled triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse and a leg of one of the triangles are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding leg of the other triangle.
The adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.
A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.
So, a rectangle is a parallelogram in which every angle is a right angle.
Property: The diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
An acute angle measures between 0° and 90°.
whereas a right angle is exactly equal to 90°.
An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle.
Theorem 6.6 : Lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each other.
In any triangle, the side opposite to the larger (greater) angle is longer.
Theorem 8.2 : In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.
If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal.
Theorem 8.3 : If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a parallelogram.
Theorem 8.4 : In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal.
Theorem 8.5 : If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then it is a parallelogram.
Theorem 8.6 : The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
Theorem 8.7 : If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then it is a parallelogram.
A rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a right angle.
Theorem 8.8 : A quadrilateral is a parallelogram if a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel.
Theorem 8.9 : The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side.
Theorem 8.10 : The line drawn through the mid-points of one side of a triangle, parallel to another side bisects the third side.
The chord, which passes through the centre of the circle, is called a diameter of the circle.
Theorem 10.4 : The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
